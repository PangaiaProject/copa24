Evan Eichler is a Professor of Genome Sciences and Howard Hughes Medical
Institute Investigator. He received his Ph.D.
from Baylor College of Medicine. After his postdoctoral fellowship at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he joined
Case Western Reserve University in 1997 and the University of Washington
in 2004. His research group provided the first
genome-wide view of segmental duplications within human and primate
genomes. He is a leader in identifying and
sequencing normal and disease-causing structural variation in the human
genome. The long-term goal of his research is to
understand the evolution and mechanisms of recent gene duplication and
its relationship to copy number variation and
human disease with a specific emphasis on the genetic architecture of
autism and neurodevelopmental delay.
