I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carleton College. My research centers around designing algorithms for analysis of high-throughput DNA sequencing data. In particular, my work focuses around applications in cancer genomics.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher and graduate student in the Computer Science Department at Brown University where I worked with Ben Raphael. I recieved a PhD and ScM in Computer Science from Brown University and a BA in Mathematics from Pomona College. I also spent several years working for Epic as a software tester.
