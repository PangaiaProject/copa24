I received a Ph.D. in Molecular Medicine from the University of Milan. After an
initial focus on the genetics of human neuromuscular disorders, I developed an
interest for comparative genomics and for the evolution of non-coding
sequences. Since 2007 I have been coordinating a research team with a focus in
computational biology. In recent years, my research has mainly centered on the
application of evolutionary approaches to study host-pathogen interactions in
mammals and to investigate the evolutionary history of human pathogens. 

My group applies computational approaches to identify positive selection signals,
to achieve molecular dating, and to perform phylogeographic analyses. We use
wet-lab approaches to validate the predictions we generate in silico. I am a
member of the ICTV Arenaviriadae Study Group and I serve as the Co-Chief Editor
of Infection, Genetics and Evolution.

I am currently Associate Professor of Genetics at the University of Milano-Bicocca.
