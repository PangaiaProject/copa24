      <description>Dr. Gusfield&amp;rsquo;s primary interests involve the efficiency of algorithms, particularly for problems in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. These algorithms have been applied to study data security, stable matching, network flow, matroid optimization, string/pattern matching problems, molecular sequence analysis and optimization problems in population-scale genomics.&#xA;Currently, he is focused on string and combinatorial problems that arise in computational biology and bioinformatics.&#xA;Dr. Gusfield served as chair of the computer science department at UC Davis from July 2000 until August 2004, and was the founding Editor-in-Chief of The IEEE/ACM Transactions of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics until January 2009.</description>
